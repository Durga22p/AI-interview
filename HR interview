HR: "Suppose you’re given a messy dataset with lots of missing values. How would you handle it before analysis?"
JobSeeker: "First, I’d check the extent of missing data.
            If it’s small, I’d drop those rows/columns.
            If it’s significant, I’d use techniques like mean/median/mode imputation, forward/backward fill, or predictive models depending on the feature type and business impact."
HR: "Niceee  That’s exactly how a thoughtful analyst would approach it — balancing data quality with business needs.
Next one: Imagine your manager asks you for insights, but the data doesn’t really show anything strong or clear. How would you handle that situation?"
JobSeeker: "I’d be honest and say the data doesn’t show strong patterns.
            Then, I’d present what’s observable, explain possible reasons, and suggest collecting more data or alternative metrics.
            I’d also give them clear visuals so they can see the limitations themselves."
HR: "Love that answer  — honesty + clarity + visuals = manager-friendly!
Next scenario: You’ve got 3 tasks — building a report due today, cleaning a dataset due tomorrow, and preparing a presentation for next week. How would you prioritize?"
JobSeeker: "I’d finish the report first since it’s due today.
            Next, I’d focus on cleaning the dataset for tomorrow.
            Then I’d break the presentation into smaller parts and work on it gradually before next week.
            This way, deadlines are met without last-minute pressure."
HR: " Smart and structured — that’s exactly the time management we look for!
Okay, now imagine: You find an unusual spike in sales data for one region. How would you go about verifying whether it’s a real trend or just an error?"
JobSeeker: "First, I’d check the raw data for entry errors or duplicates.
            Then, I’d compare it with past trends and cross-check with external factors like promotions or events.
            If it’s consistent and supported by context, it’s a real trend; if not, likely a data issue."
HR: "Spot on!  That’s exactly the kind of detective work we love in a data analyst.
Quick one: If your colleague disagrees with your analysis findings, how would you handle it?"
JobSeeker: "I’d listen to their viewpoint calmly, review the data together, and explain my methodology clearly.
             If needed, I’d re-check the analysis and stay open to adjusting conclusions based on valid points."
HR: "Nice  — respectful, collaborative, and data-driven. That’s teamwork gold!
Last one for now: If you could choose one skill to master next that would make you a better data analyst, what would it be?"
JobSeeker: "I’d choose advanced machine learning, especially deep learning, to uncover deeper insights and make more accurate predictions."
HR: "Ooo nice choice  — deep learning is powerful and totally next-level for data analysis. Love your growth mindset! 🚀
